<h4>HTML5 Tutorial</h4>
<h5>Summary: Create basic web applications utilizing HTML5</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: MS Windows or MacOS, Web Browser, and VS Code</h5>
			
<p>Instructions: Complete the HTML5 tutorial from W3C <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">[link]</a>

<p>Part 1 of this tutorial begins with “HTML Home” and ends when you have completed the “HTML Images” section.</p>
<p>Part 2 picks up with “HTML Tables” and ends with “HTML vs. XHTML” </p>
	
Be sure to follow along and complete the steps yourself. As you go through the tutorial, you should make the resulting 
application uniquely your own by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing 
the names of variables, and adding small features.</p>

<p>Be sure to save your work so that you can submit it as part of an assignment.</p>
