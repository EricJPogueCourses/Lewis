</ul>

<em>Requirement 1</em>

    <li>Lists</li>
	<li>Tables</li>
	<li>Hyperlinks to an external page</li>
	<li>Hyperlinks within a page</li>
</ol>
 	
<em>Requirement 3</em>
<p>You will need to create an external CSS style sheet named “my-favorite-hobby.css” that will style your HTML page.

<ol>
    <li>Transition</li>
    <li>Animation</li>
	<li>Transform</li>
</ol>

<em>Requirement 4: </em>

	<li>Throughout the development process you should validate your HTML utilizing the W3C HTML validator</li>
	<li>Fully test your page by viewing and testing it in both the FireFox and Chrome browsers</li>
	<li>Be careful to save and track your work as you will likely need to submit and publish the page later</li>
</ol>
