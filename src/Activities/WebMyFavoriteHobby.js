<h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
<h5>Summary: Create a HTML page describing your favorite hobby</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: Windows 10 or MacOS, VS Code, HTML, and CSS</h5>
			
<p>The My Favorite Hobby project is a project where you will create a web page using HTML5 and CSS that highlights your 
favorite hobby. For example, you may find a passion around:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Travel</li>
	<li>Sports</li>
	<li>Music</li>
    <li>Or just about anything else...</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us something about your hobby, why you find it interesting, your proudest hobby related accomplishment, and 
maybe how someone else might get started with this hobby.</p>
 	
<em>Requirement #1</em>
<p>Your application should be submitted in a zip file named "hobby_xxx.zip" where xxx are your initials in lower case. 
The primary HTML file for your application must be "my-favorite-hobby.html" and needs to be in the root directory of 
your zip file so that when the zip file is extracted to an empty directory you are able to click on the file and bring 
up the application.</p>

<em>Requirement #2</em>
<p>Your page should be aesthetically pleasing, well organized, and make use of the following HTML5 elements at a minium:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
	<li>Tables</li>
	<li>Hyperlinks to an external page</li>
	<li>Hyperlinks within a page</li>
</ul>
<p>You should use these elements in non-trivial ways. In other words, they have to serve a purpose in the page.</p>
 	
<em>Requirement #3</em>
<p>You will need to create a CSS style sheet that will style your HTML page. The styling should be applied to all 
elements of your page. Also, you must make use of at least one of the following properties (specify which you chose in 
a CSS comment):</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
    <li>Transition</li>
    <li>Animation</li>
	<li>Transform</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you must make use of the hover pseudoclass.</p>
<p>The style sheet should be created in a separate file with a .css extension and then linked to your HTML page.</p>

<em>Requirement #4</em> 	
<p>Your page should display correctly when using the Firefox and Google Chrome browser. You need to validate both your 
HTML5 file and your CSS3 file using the W3C validator service. Your files should have no errors and validate 
successfully as HTML5 and CSS3, respectively. Both, your HTML5 and CSS3 code needs to follow proper programming style. 
This includes use of whitespace (line breaks and indents) to separate sections of your code and comments (in both HTML 
and CSS) to document your code. At the top of each file, put a block comment containing your name, course name, project 
number, and semester.</p>

<em>Final notes and request for Feedback</em>
<p>Be certain to verify that what you submit loads and displays appropriately. </p>
<p>Do not copy another student’s work. I may use MOSS or similar software to detect plagiarism and will not ask for 
clarification if MOSS concludes you have copied another student’s work. Plagiarism of any type is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Tackle this problem gradually and make sure that you review the examples that we cover in class. The main goal of 
our discussions, lectures, and examples this week are intended to allow you to successfully deliver this application. 
Also, don’t hesitate to post something on our discussion board or to reach out to me directly if you need assistance.</p>
<p>Definitely pace yourself. Do not attempt to do this in one night.</p>
<p>Good luck – and have fun. This is, indeed, supposed to be fun.</p>

suggestion will get you a point.</p>
