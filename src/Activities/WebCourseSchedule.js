<em>Final notes and request for Feedback</em>
<p>If your solution does not compile and execute without errors when it is submitted, you will lose the 4 points AND 
I will send it back to you to fix and resubmit before I attempt to continue grading the assignment.</p>

<p>Do not copy another student’s work. I may use MOSS or similar software to detect plagiarism and will not ask for 
clarification if MOSS concludes you have copied another student’s work.</p>

our discussions, lectures, and examples this week are intended to allow you to successfully deliver this application. 
Also, don’t hesitate to post something on our discussion board or to reach out to me directly if you need assistance.</p>
