<h4>Hello World with Python</h4>
<h5>Summary: Convert between various Numbering Systems utilizing Python</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: Python (v3), VS Code, and Terminal</h5>
			
<p>Instructions: Complete Hello World using the following video tutorial as a guide. As in all tutorials, you 
should follow along and complete the steps yourself. As you go through the tutorial, make the resulting application 
uniquely your own by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing the 
names of variables, and adding small features. Finally, be sure to save your work as you will often be asked to 
submit it as part of an assignment.</p>
