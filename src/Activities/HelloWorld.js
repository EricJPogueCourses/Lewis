<h4>Hello World with {app.language}</h4>
<h5>Summary: Create and execute a {app.language} application that prints a special version of “Hello World” that includes your
name in possessive form with a curly apostrophe followed by “Hello World” to the terminal</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: {app.prerequisites}</h5>
			
<p>Instructions: Complete Hello World using {app.language}. However in our version of Hello World, we are going to add some
special formatting. Specifically, we are going to add our preferred first name followed by our last name in possessive form 
along with a curly apostrophe (“ ’ ”). For example my hello world output would be “Eric Pogue’s Hello World” including 
the curly apostrophe.</p>

<p>Why do we need to utilize a curly apostrophe? Well, it turns out that curly quotes and curly apostrophes should always
be utilized in written text. The following article from Practical Typography does a nice job of explaining the 
rational<a href='https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[link]</a>.
Equally important, becoming comfortable with utilizing curly quotes and curly apostrophes is a good starting point for 
understanding how to utilize special characters and eventually multiple languages in software applications.</p>

<p>As in all tutorials, you should follow along and complete the steps yourself. As you go through the tutorial, make 
the resulting application uniquely your own by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, 
etc.), changing the names of variables, and adding small features. Finally, be sure to save your work as you will often 
be asked to submit it as part of an assignment.</p>
