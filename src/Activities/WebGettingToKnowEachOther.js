<h4>Getting to Know Each Other</h4>
<h5>Summary: Create an HTML page describing yourself</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: Windows 10 or MacOS, VS Code, FireFox, Chrome, HTML, and CSS</h5>
			
<p>In this project you will create an HTML and CSS based web page about yourself. You will need to hand code this page 
in VS Code so that you can fully understand the HTML and CSS that makes up a web page.</p>

<em>Requirement 1</em>
<p>Create an aesthetically pleasing web page in HTML and CSS that includes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A heading section at the top with your full name centered on the page</li>
	<li>A line with your preferred name only if it is different from your first name listed above</li>
	<li>Your Lewis email address on a separate line as an HTML email link</li>
	<li>A high quality and representative head and shoulders photo of yourself appropriately sized and centered</li>
</ol>

<em>Requirement 2</em>
<p>Enhance your web page by adding:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A sub-heading labeled “Introduction”</li>
	<li>One or two paragraphs about yourself, your family, and your major/minor</li>
	<li>A section labeled “What I Hope to Learn in this Course”</li>
	<li>A bulleted list of topics from the course that interest you most</li>

</ol>

<em>Requirement 3</em>
<p>Enhance your web page so that it includes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A section labeled “My Favorite Hobby” with a paragraph or two about your favorite hobby</li>
	<li>A section labeled “Greatest Innovation” that includes:
		<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
			<li>A list of the three greatest innovations in computing history with square icons (like this list)</li>
			<li>Each list item should include and external link to another web page that also describes the innovation</li>	
		</ul></li>
	<li>Go back to your bulleted list from “What I Hope to Learn in this Course” and make those of square icons also</li>
	<li>Finally, your page should close with a “Fun Fact” section that includes something about you that is uniquely 
		you that we help your your classmates remember you better</li>
</ol>

<em>Requirement 4</em>
<p>Test and validate your web page:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Validate that you are following our HTML and CSS coding standards</li>
	<li>Throughout the development process you should validate your HTML utilizing the W3C HTML validator</li>
	<li>Fully test your page by viewing and testing it in both the FireFox and Chrome browsers</li>
	<li>Be careful to save and track your work as you will likely need to submit and publish the page later</li>
</ol>
