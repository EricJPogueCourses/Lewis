<h4>HTML Tutorial</h4>
<h5>Summary: Create basic web applications utilizing HTML and CSS</h5>
<h5>Prerequisites: Windows 10 or MacOS, Web Browser, and VS Code</h5>
			
<p>Instructions: Complete the HTML tutorial from W3C <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/'>[link]</a></p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType:'square' }}>
	<li>Part 1 of this tutorial begins with “HTML Home” and ends when you have completed the “HTML Images” section</li>
	<li>Part 2 picks up with “HTML Tables” and ends with “HTML vs. XHTML”</li>
</ul>
<p>You should follow along and complete the steps yourself. As you go through the tutorial, you will need to make the 
resulting application uniquely your own by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), 
changing the names of variables, and adding small features.</p>

<p>Be sure to save your work so that you can submit it as part of an assignment.</p>
