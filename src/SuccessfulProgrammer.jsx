	<h4>How to Be a Successful Programmer</h4>
        <p>For many of us this is likely our first time doing sophisticated programming. Programming can be a very
        creative and rewarding endeavor. However, programming can also feel overwhelming at times. This is completely
        normal. When you start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated, consider taking a break from the problem for a while
        and coming back with a fresh set of eyes. Be sure to save your work after you make yourself a couple of comments
        so that you know where to start when you return.</p>

        <p>Below are some additional suggestions on how to Be a successful programmer:</p>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "square" }}>
            <li>Start early and allocate time in sufficient blocks of an hour or more. Programming is very difficult
            when in small blocks of time to deliver at the last minute or by working in small blocks of time.</li>
            <li>Establish a physical work environment where you can focus and not be interrupted</li>
            <li>Compete features and requirements one at a time. Always keep in mind that completing 5 out of 9
            requirements is vastly more valuable (and worth more points) than partially completing all nine
            requirements</li>
            <li>Save working versions of your project regularly to allow yourself to experiment without risking what you
            have already accomplished. Git and GitHub (and possibly branches) are the perfect way to do this.</li>
            <li>Allow sufficient time to test and submit your work after have completed your programming activities. You
            should leave yourself plenty of time to review, test, package, and submit your assignment.</li>
            <li>Become comfortable with your operating system, development environment, and tools.</li>
            <li>Read or re-read the project requirements and related materials.</li>
            <li>Do not be afraid to make changes to the features or requirements if you feel you have found a better
            way. Always be sure to document those changes so that others can admire your enhancements</li>
            <li>Ask for help if you are stuck. It's amazing how often simply articulating the problem/question will lead
            you to finding the answer</li>
            <li>Fully participate in tutorials and class exercises.</li>
            <li>Become comfortable with searching the solutions in past projects, class tutorials, books, and on the
            Internet. However, always make sure that the final product is <strong>your own</strong></li>
            <li>Reward yourself for progress. Give yourself a pat on the back each time you make meaningful
            progress.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>Programming can be a creative and enjoyable endeavor. I assure you that it will be more enjoyable, and you
        will be more successful, if you give yourself sufficient time, work in a productive environment, iteratively
        develop and test your code, and leave yourself sufficient time to submit your projects. </p>
