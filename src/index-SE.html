	<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
	<h3>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Software Engineering Methods, Software as a Service, and Tools of the Trade</h3>

	<p><em>Welcome to Software Engineering!</em> By this point in your software development journey
	I'm sure that you are confident in writing moderately complicated software programs. You've
	learned about structured programming techniques like sequence, selection, and repetition. You've
	learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable pieces by using functions.
	You've even understand Object-Oriented Programming can help you develope more complex
	applications by utilizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. </p>

	<p>That's wonderful, however to create sophisticated modern programs we need to master some
	additional skills that allow us to effectively work across teams to predictably develop, enhance,
	and maintain complex systems that meet real users needs.  These additional Software Engineering
	skills are included in what we call the Software Development Life Cycle and include topics like
	Project Management, Architecture, Requirements, Testing, Support, and Maintenance. These are some of
	the topics that we will be exploring as part of this Software Engineering course.</p>

	<p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course
	activities and assignments. Sprints are part of the Scrum development process. The term is used to
	describe a unit of work which will be delivered in a given amount of time. We will be learning
	more about sprints, Scrum, and Agile development in the coming days. For now it is sufficient to
	know that our sprint 1 activities listed below are expected to take approximately 20 hours of
	focused effort to complete.</p>

	<p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
		<li>describe the basic steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</li>
		<li>compare and contrast software life cycle methodologies</li>
		<li>explain why agile development has become the preferred software development process</li>
		<li>define software quality</li>
		<li>describe software as a service and its benefits</li>
		<li>explain legacy code</li>
		<li>list the pros and cons of cloud computing</li>
		<li>describe client-server, three-tier and MVC design patterns</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
	listed in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. Each item is expected to
	take 10 to 30 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted. Highlighted activities are
	<em>directly</em> related to graded assignments.</p>

	<h3>Sprint 7: Design Patterns, Model-View-Controller, Application Architecture, and Final Project</h3>

	<p>Welcome to sprint 7. This sprint will see us focussing more on our final project while we also take a look
	at the important topic of Design Patterns.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
		<li>Utilize your knowledge of Agile development and Saas to deliver additional features for our final project</li>
		<li>Understand Design Patterns with a particular focus on the Model-View-Controller pattern</li>
		<li>Understand Application architecture particularly as it relates to Object-Oriented Programming and Databases</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Review our sprint 7 assignments in Blackboard that include discussion board 7, quiz 7, lab 7, and
			reflections 7</em></li>
		<li>Continue working on your final project project and implement and test additional high priority functionality that you 
			identified last sprint</li>
		<li>Update your final project Requirements for next sprint and document your commitment for what you will
