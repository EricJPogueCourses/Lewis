	<h5>Sprint 2: Node.js, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and Azure</h5>

	<p><em>Welcome to sprint 2.</em> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. However, we didn't get a
	chance to write much code. This sprint get your code editors out. We are going to start practicing some of the
	concepts we learned.</p>

	<p>By the end of sprint 2 we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{ listStyleType: "square" }}>
		<li>Write simple HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js applications and install them to Azure</li>
		<li>Understand simple Ruby programs using basic control structures and data structures</li>
		<li>Write and interpret regular expressions</li>
		<li>Comfortably be able to utilize single-developer workflow with Git and GitHub</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Once again you are welcome to
	pursue the activities in any order you prefer. However, they are listed in the order I think will be the most
