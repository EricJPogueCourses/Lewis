	<h5>Sprint 7: Thunderbird, Final Project v1, and Application Architecture</h5>
	
	<p><em>Welcome to sprint 7.</em> How time flies. We have two separate programming assignments this sprint. The
	first assignment (PA7) is Thunderbird. We will be completing the Thunderbird application by the middle of the
	sprint. Thunderbird is also different than previous assignments in that we will be enhancing an existing
	application rather than creating a new application from scratch. This is more like what you could expect in an
	entry level professional programming position. I think you will enjoy it.</p>

	<p>The second half of the sprint will be entirely focused on completing version 1 of your final project. 
	which will be submitted by the end of the sprint in programming assignment 7b.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
		<ul style={{ listStyleType:'square'}}>
		<li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multi-threaded Java applications</li>
		<li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
		<li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Notice that in this sprint we have two programming assignments. I would highly encourage you to try to
	complete the Thunderbird assignment (PA7a) by the middle of the sprint so that you can be working on your final
	project during the second half of the sprint. Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Review Programming Assignment 7a Thunderbird, Programming Assignment 7b Final Project v1, Quiz 7,
		and Discuss Board (DB) 7</em></li>
		<li>Complete the ThunderbirdLite<NavLink to='/activity-oop/java-thunderbird-lite'>[video]</NavLink>using the ThunderbirdLite source code from the
			'https://github.com/EricJPogueCourses/Thunderbird.git' repository as needed</li>
		<li style={{color:'red'}}><em>Complete Programming Assignment 7a Thunderbird by the middle of the sprint ~6
			hours</em></li>
		<li><em>Complete your initial Discussion Board post by the middle of the sprint</em></li>
		<li>Continue to monitor and update your DB6 thread from last sprint and update your JSON contact files as
		necessary</li>
		<li><em>Consistently work on the version 1 of your Final Project throughout the sprint ~6 hours</em></li>
		<li>Complete “Application Architectures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Databases - Part 1”<NavLink to='/activity-architecture/application-architecture-part1'>[video]</NavLink></li>
		<li><em>Complete all activity list items and assignments including PA7a Thunderbird, PA7b Final Project v1, Quiz
			7, and discussion board 7 by the end of the sprint</em></li>
	</ol>
