<h5>Sprint 7: Thunderbird, Final Project sprint 0, and Application Architecture</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to sprint 7.</em> How time flies. We have two separate programming activities this sprint. The first 
assignment is Thunderbird. Thunderbird is different than previous assignments in that we will be enhancing an existing
application rather than creating a new application from scratch. This is more like what you could expect in an
entry level professional programming position. I think you will enjoy it.</p>

<p>The second half of the sprint will be entirely focused on completing sprint 0 of your final project.</p>

<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multi-threaded Java applications</li>
	<li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
	<li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that in this sprint we have two programming assignments. I encourage you to complete Thunderbird by the 
middle of the sprint so that you can be 100% focused on your final project during the second half of the sprint.</p>
