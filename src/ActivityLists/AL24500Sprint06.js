<h5>Sprint 6: Multithreaded Programming and Application Programming Interfaces</h5>

<p>Sprint 6! This sprint offers a mix of the old and the new. Some things like hosting JSON files on our Azure
websites and enhancing our SwissArmyKnife application will be additions to what we have already learned. On the
other hand, learning how to write multi-threaded Java applications will likely prove to be challenging.</p>

<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
	<li>Develop our first multi-threaded Java application</li>
	<li>Create and update a web service by hosting JSON files in Azure</li>
	<li>Enhance intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
	<li>Create an automated (api level) Java test client</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Stay focused on the due dates by reviewing our course calendar<NavLink to='/calendar/6'>[link]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Review Lab 6, Quiz 6, Discussion 6, Reflection 6, and Lab Demo</em></li>
