<h5>Sprint 5: Networks, Encryption, Hashing, and Final Projects</h5>

<p><em>Wow!</em> We made it to the halfway point. I hope you enjoyed 
<span style={{color: "red"}}> &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;</span> Matchmaker <span style={{color: "red"}}>&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;</span>.
This week we switch gears and move into graphical drawing using Turtle graphics.</p>

<p>We will also start working on our Final Project proposals this sprint. How would you like to finishing the course by 
creating something that makes you proud? What type of a final project would you enjoy creating? Is there a final project 
that would both be interesting to create and be something you could add to your professional portfolio as you are 
looking for internships or jobs? How can I help?</p>

<p>You will also notice a continuing trend this sprint where assignments will become less prescriptive and you
will have more control <em>and responsibility</em> in determining what is done and how it is implemented.</p>

<p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 5:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Explore Networks</li>
	<li>Understand Functions</li>
	<li>Understand Encryption and Hashing</li>
	<li>Create your initial Final Project Proposal</li>
</ul>
