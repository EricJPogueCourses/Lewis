<h5>Sprint 2: Patterns, Principles, and Java Programming</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to sprint 2.</em> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. However, we didn't get a
chance to write much code. This sprint get your Java compilers out. We are going to start practicing some of the
concepts we learned. </p>

<p>By the end of sprint 2 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss OOP Principles</li>
	<li>Create, modify, compile, and execute OOP based Java applications</li>
	<li>Manage and submit source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
	<li>Utilize JSON to represent program data</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Once again you are welcome to
pursue the activities in any order you prefer. However, they are listed in the order I think will be the most
beneficial for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40
minutes unless otherwise noted.</p>
