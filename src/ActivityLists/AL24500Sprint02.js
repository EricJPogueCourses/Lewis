<h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
<h5>Sprint 2: Patterns, Principles, UML, and more Java Programming</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to sprint 2.</em> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. We even did some programming by completing
Matchmaker with Java. How did Matchmaker go? Keep your Java compilers out for this sprint. We are going to start 
practicing some of the concepts we learned while we continue to learn more about object-oriented programming (OOP) as 
we focus on OOP Patterns and Principles.</p>

<p>By the end of sprint 2 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss object-oriented Patterns and Principles</li>
	<li>Create, modify, compile, and execute OOP based Java applications</li>
	<li>Manage and submit source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
	<li>Utilize UML and JSON to represent program data</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Once again you are welcome to
pursue the activities in any order you prefer. However, they are listed in the order I think will be the most
beneficial for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40
minutes unless otherwise noted.</p>
