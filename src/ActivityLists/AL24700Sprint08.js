<h5>Sprint 8: Final Project</h5>

<p>You made it. Very well done! Thank you for your dedication, support, and participation. All that’s left is to finish 
strong and deliver a Final Project that makes you proud. Don’t do it for me, don’t do it for the grade, do it for 
yourself.</p>  

<p>By the end of the sprint you will:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Deliver a sophisticated web application utilizing technologies that include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, 
		Azure, and Node.js or PHP</li>
    <li>Explore leading edge web development technology trends and determine where you would like to focus your future learning 
		efforts</li>
</ul>  

<p>Very intentionally, I have removed almost everything except our Final Project from our activities list in hopes 
that we will be able to focus entirely on delivering something special. Even our discussion Board topic is trivial and 
does not require you to post anything.</p>

<p>With this in mind our activities list includes:</p>
<ol>
	<li style={{color:'red'}}>Stay laser focused on the due dates by reviewing our course calendar<NavLink to='/calendar/8'>[link]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Confirm your final project presentation date &amp; time</em></li>
	<li>Review sprint 8 assignments including lab, quiz, discussion, and reflection</li>
    <li>Complete Final Project version 2 (~16 hours)</li>
    <li><em>Submit your Final Project and all assignment including lab 8, quiz 8, and reflection 8
		<em style={{color:'red'}}> at least two hours prior to your scheduled Final Project presentation time</em></em></li>
	<li><em>Submit all assignments including your Final Project, lab 8, quiz 8, and reflection 8
		<em style={{color:'red'}}> at least two hours prior to your scheduled Final Project presentation time</em></em></li>
 </ol>

<p>Let’s finish strong. Let me know where I can help. It has been a sincere pleasure.</p>
