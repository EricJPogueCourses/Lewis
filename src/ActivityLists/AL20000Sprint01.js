<h5>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Number Systems, and Tools of the Trade</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science!</em> In this course we will be exploring the field of computer 
science topics including computer architecture, networking, data organization, and security. Together we will explore 
algorithms, abstractions, computational problem solving and programming. </p>

<p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities. Sprints 
are part of the Scrum software development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work which will be delivered 
in a given amount of time. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the coming days. For now it is 
sufficient to know that our sprint 1 activities listed below are expected to take approximately 18 hours of focused 
effort to complete.</p>

<p>Let's start with our sprint 1 Learning Objectives. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType: "square"}}>
	<li>Effectively participate in a blended classroom setting</li>
	<li>Understand the basics of Scrum and effectively participate in a Scrum team</li>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss numbering systems and various data representations</li>
	<li>Utilize command line and graphical tools to navigate our computer operating system and local file system</li>
	<li>Create, edit, and execute basic Python source code and applications</li>
	<li>Manage source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
listed in the order I think will be the most efficient for you to work through the topics. Each item is expected to
take 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted. <em>Highlighted activities are directly related to 
graded assignments.</em> Throughout the course I try to consistently utilize the “assignment” term to indicate a 
<em>graded</em> activity.</p>

	<li><em>Create your initial Discussion 1 post by the middle of the sprint</em></li>
	<li>Read Chapter 2 of Dale and review the associated class lecture [[Todo: Record and post class lecture.]]</li>
	
	<li>Complete the “Hello World” in Python tutorial [[Todo: Create tutorial]] As in all tutorials, you should follow along and complete the steps
		yourself. As you go through the tutorial, you should make the resulting application uniquely your own by adding
		standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing the names of variables, adding
		small features, etc. Finally, be sure to save your unique creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as
		part of your programming assignment.
