<h4>Introduction to Computer Science</h4>
<h5>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Number Systems, and Tools of the Trade</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science!</em> In this course we will be exploring the field of computer
science including topics including computer architecture, networking, data organization, and security. Together we 
will explore algorithms, abstractions, computational problem solving and programming. </p>

<p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities and
assignments. Sprints are part of the Scrum software development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work which will
be delivered in a given amount of time. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the coming days. For now
it is sufficient to know that our sprint 1 activities listed below are expected to take approximately 18 hours of
focused effort to complete.</p>

<p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType: "square" }}>
	<li>Understand and effectively participate in a blended classroom setting</li>
	<li>Understand the basics of Scrum and Agile software development</li>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss numbering systems</li>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss various data representations</li>
	<li>Execute basic Python applications utilizing Python command line tools</li>
	<li>Utilize command line and graphical tools to navigate our computer operating system and local file system</li>
	<li>Create, edit, and update source code in a text editor</li>
	<li>Manage source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
	<li>Understand basic Scrum development techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
listed in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. Each item is expected to
take 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted. <em>Highlighted activities are directly related to 
graded assignments.</em></p>

		standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing the names of variables, adding
		small features, etc. Finally, be sure to save your unique creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as
		part of your programming assignment.
