<h4>Introduction to Computer Science</h4>
<h5>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Number Systems, and Tools of the Trade</h5>

<p>Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science! In this course we will be exploring the field of computer 
science. The course will include an overview of computer architecture, networking, data organization, and security. 
Together we will also explore algorithms, abstractions, computational problem solving, and programming. </p>

<p>You likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities. Sprints are 
part of the Scrum software development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work which will be delivered by
a given date. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the coming days. For now it is sufficient to know 
that our sprint 1 activities will need to be completed by the end of sprint 1 and are expected to take approximately 18 
hours of focused effort to complete.</p>

<p>Let’s start with our sprint 1 Learning Objectives. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType: "square"}}>
	<li>Effectively participate in a blended classroom environment</li>
	<li>Understand the basics of Scrum and participate in a Scrum team</li>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss numbering systems and data representations</li>
	<li>Utilize command line and graphical tools to navigate our computer operating system and file system</li>
	<li>Create, edit, and execute basic Python source code and applications</li>
	<li>Begin to understand algorithmic thinking, representation, programming, and design</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
listed in the order I think will be the most efficient to complete. Expect each item to take 20 to 40 minutes of 
focused time unless otherwise noted. <em>Bold</em> items are graded assignments.</p>
