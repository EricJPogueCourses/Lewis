<h5>Sprint 2: Numbering Systems, Data Representation, HTML, Cascading Style Sheets, and more Tools of the Trade</h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 2 of Introduction to Computer Science. In sprint 2 we are going to continue our journey into data
representation and also take look at some of the key technologies that make up the Web. Our sprint activities will 
include a detailed look at two of those technologies by introducing HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>

<p>Once again let’s start with our Learning Objectives. By the end of sprint 2 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss data representation</li>
	<li>Identify and classify Internet, Web, and distributed applications</li>
	<li>Develop browser based HTML5 applications that utilize common HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) elements</li>
	<li>Utilize important developer tools and services create, update, and deploy basic software applications</li>
</ul> 

<p>Below is our sprint 2 activities list. Once again they are provided in the order that I think will be the most
efficient for you and the <em>bold</em> items are graded assignments.</p>
