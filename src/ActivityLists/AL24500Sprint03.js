	<h5>Sprint 3: Graphical User Interfaces and FaceDraw</h5>

	<p>Welcome to Sprint 3. We have covered a lot in the first two sprints. Much of it was preparing us for our first
	substantial programming assignment. I believe we are ready to apply what we have learned to our FaceDraw project. Be
	sure to get an early start on the project and stay focused. You will note that there are fewer items on our
	activities list this week. That is because you will need to focus your time and energy on FaceDraw.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
		<li>Develop a moderately sophisticated graphical Java application (FaceDraw)</li>
		<li>Comfortably utilize our command-line Java development environment and VS Code editor</li>
		<li>Utilize source code management and Git/GitHub</li>
		<li>Effectively compile, debug, submit, update, and manage Java application source code</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As you would expect, our activities list for this sprint (below) is laser focused on helping us achieve the above
	Learning Objectives. Once again I have attempted to list the items in the order that I think will be most
	beneficial for you to complete them.</p>
