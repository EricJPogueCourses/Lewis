<h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
<h5>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Concepts, Patterns, and Tools of the Trade</h5>

<p><em>Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming!</em> By this point in your programming journey I'm sure that you are 
confident in writing basic software programs. You've learned about structured programming techniques like sequence, 
selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable pieces by using 
functions. That's great, but to create modern programs you need to master some additional skills. These additional skills 
are what object-oriented programming give us.</p>

<p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities and
assignments. Sprints are part of the Scrum development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work which will
be delivered in a given amount of time. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the coming days. For now
it is sufficient to know that our sprint 1 activities listed below are expected to take approximately 20 hours of
focused effort to complete.</p>

<p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
	<li>Effectively participate in a blended classroom environment and as part of a Scrum team</li>
	<li>Identify and understand key object-oriented programming concepts</li>
	<li>Identify, define, and discuss object-oriented programming patterns</li>
	<li>Utilize important developer tools to create and update basic software applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
listed in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. Each item is expected to
take 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted. <em>Highlighted activities are directly related to 
graded assignments.</em></p>
<ol>
	<li>Review course syllabus</li>
	<li><em>Review Programming Assignment 1, Quiz 1, and Discussion Board 1</em></li>
	<li>Complete Tools of the Trade<NavLink to='/tools'>[link]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Understand how Blended Learning, Flipped Classroom, and Online class formats relate by reviewing 'Blended
		Learning &amp; Flipped Classroom'<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paQCE58334M&vl=en-US' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[video]</a></li>
	<li>Review “Introduction to Scrum in 7 Minutes”<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA'>[video]</a></li>
	<li>Complete “Object-Oriented Programming Concepts and Practices”<NavLink to='/activity-oop/concepts-and-practices'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Consistently work on Programming Assignment 1 and Quiz 1 throughout the sprint ~6 hours</em></li>
	<li>Add your photo to your Blackboard profile<NavLink to='/activity/photo-to-blackboard'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Complete the Java “Hello World” tutorial. As in all tutorials, you should follow along and complete the steps
		yourself. As you go through the tutorial, you should make the resulting application uniquely your own by adding
		standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing the names of variables, adding
		small features, etc. Finally, be sure to save your unique creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as
		part of your programming assignment.<NavLink to='/activity-oop/java-hello-world'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Complete “Object-Oriented Programming Patterns”<NavLink to='/activity-oop/patterns'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Complete Discussion Board 1 by responding to at least one of your classmates' posts</em></li>
	<li><em>Complete and submit Programming Assignment 1 and Quiz 1</em></li>
</ol>
