	<h5>Sprint 5: Software Maintenance, Final Project Proposal, and production Azure Site Setup</h5>

	<p>Welcome to sprint 5. This sprint marks the start of our final project. Think of this sprint as your final project
	sprint 1 (of 4). In this sprint you will be defining your final project in terms Epics and User Stories, submitting
	them as part of Lab 5, and sharing them with your classmates' as part of Discussion Board 5. If you would like to
	work on your final project with a partner, this will also be the time for you to find a partner.</p>

	<p>Now that we have demonstrated our ability to work in a HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Node.js software as
	a service (Saas) environment, we will be setting up the production environment for our final project and migrating
	all of our previous application/lab assignments to that new site.</p>

	<p>Finally, we will be continuing our software engineering process knowledge journey by studying software
	maintenance.</p>

	<p>By the end of sprint 5 we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
		<li>Utilize our knowledge of Agile requirements to develop our final project proposal utilizing Epics and
		Stories</li>
		<li>Setup our production Azure Node.js site for our final project and migrate all of our previous application to
		the new site</li>
		<li>Fully test and verify our production site and its applications</li>
		<li>Explain why change is inevitable for software systems and describe the processes involved in software
		evolution</li>
