<h4>Web and Distributed Programming</h4>
<h5>Sprint 5: Distributed applications, JavaScript, Ajax, and JSON</h5>

<p><em>Wow!</em> We made it to the halfway point. I hope you enjoyed Map Mania. This week we switch gears and move into 
writing Distributed applications using JavaScript, Ajax, and JSON.</p>

<p>We will also start working on our Final Project proposals this sprint. How would you like to finishing the course by 
creating something that makes you proud? What type of a final project would you enjoy creating? Is there a final project 
that would both be interesting to create and be something you could add to your professional portfolio as you are 
looking for internships or jobs? How can I help?</p>

<p>You will also notice a continuing trend this sprint where assignments will become less prescriptive and you
will have more control <em>and responsibility</em> in determining what is done and how it is implemented.</p>

<p>Our learning objects are that by the end of the sprint we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Implement Ajax calls utilizing JavaScript and Ajax Toolkits</li>
    <li>Understand Relational Databases and the SQL language</li>
	<li>Create interactive web applications utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
	<li>Develop and test shared JSON files</li>
</ul>  

<p>This week’s  programming assignment is called Mustang and is a small contact manager will take several sprints to 
complete. In Mustang version 1 we will be utilizing the Cloud and our Microsoft Azure accounts to post information about 
ourselves in JSON files that we can utilize to create a Distributed contact manager.</p>
