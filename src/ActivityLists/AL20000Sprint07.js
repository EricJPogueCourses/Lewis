<h5>Sprint 7: Security, JavaScript, and you setting the direction</h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 7.</p>
<p>Welcome to sprint 7. Sprint 7 puts you in the driver’s seat. You get to decide if you would benefit more by focusing 
on developing more sophisticated terminal applications using Python, or if your energy would be better spent mastering 
Web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But never forget the legendary phrase:</p>

<h5>
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center"}}>
“With great power there must also come great responsibility”<br /></div>
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center"}}>
-Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man)</div>
</h5>
<br />

<p>What will you do with all that power... and responsibility?</p>
<p>Let's start with what we need to learn in sprint 7:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Understand Computer Security</li>
	<li>Deliver more sophisticated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Website or Python Terminal development</li>
	<li>Finalize and commit to your Final Project</li> 
</ul>

	<li>Determine if you will be focusing on Web development or Python development in Sprints 7 and 8</li>
	<li>Read Dale chapter 17 Security<a href='https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/computer-science-illuminated/9781284055917/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[link]</a>
