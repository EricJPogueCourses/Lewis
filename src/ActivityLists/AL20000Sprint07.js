<h5>Sprint 7: Security, JavaScript, and you setting the direction</h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 7.</p>
<p>Welcome to sprint 7. Sprint 7 puts you in the driver’s seat. You get to decide if you would benefit more by focusing 
on developing more sophisticated terminal applications using Python, or if your energy would be better spent mastering 
Web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But never forget the legendary phrase:</p>

<h5>
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center"}}>
“With great power there must also come great responsibility”<br /></div>
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center"}}>
