<h5>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Software Engineering Life Cycles, Software as a Service, and Tools of the Trade</h5>
<p><em>Welcome to Software Engineering!</em> By this point in your software development journey I'm sure you are 
confident in writing moderately complicated software programs. You’ve learned about structured programming techniques 
like sequence, selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable 
pieces by using functions. You even understand how Object-Oriented Programming can help you develop more complex
applications by utilizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>

<p>That’s wonderful, however to create sophisticated modern programs we need to master some additional skills that 
allow us to effectively work in and across teams to predictably develop, enhance, and maintain complex systems that 
meet real users needs. These additional Software Engineering skills are included in what we call the Software 
Development Life Cycle and include topics like Project Management, Architecture, Requirements, Testing, Support, and 
Maintenance. These are some of the topics that we will be exploring as part of this Software Engineering course.</p>

<p>You likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities. Sprints are 
part of the Scrum software development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work which we have committed to
delivering by a given date. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the coming days. For now it is 
sufficient to know that our sprint 1 activities will take approximately 20 hours of focused effort to complete, and we 
need to complete the activities by the sprint 1 end date listed on our course calendar 
<NavLink to='/calendar/1'>[link]</NavLink>.</p>

<p>Let's start with our sprint 1 Learning Objectives. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
	<li>Effectively participate in a blended classroom environment and as part of a Scrum team</li>
	<li>Compare and contrast the steps in leading Software Development Life Cycles</li>
	<li>Explain why agile development has become the preferred software development process</li>
	<li>Describe the benefits of software as a service and cloud computing</li>
	<li>Describe client-server, three-tier and MVC design patterns</li>
	<li>Utilize leading developer tools to create and update software applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
listed in the order I think will be the most efficient to complete. Expect each item to take 20 to 40 minutes of 
focused time unless otherwise noted. <em>Bold</em> items are graded assignments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain laser focus on due dates by reviewing our sprint calendar<NavLink to='/calendar/1'>[link]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Review course syllabus<a href={syllabusURL}>[link]</a></li>
	<li>Understand Blended Learning by reviewing “Blended Learning &amp; Flipped Classroom”<NavLink to='/activity/blended-learning'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Be prepared to participate in a Scrum team by watching “Introduction to Scrum in 7 Minutes”<NavLink to='/activity/scrum-in-7-minutes'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Review sprint 1 assignments including Introduction, Lab 1, Quiz 1, Discussion 1, and Reflection 1</em></li>
	<li>Start working on “Tools of the Trade”<NavLink to='/activity/tools'>[link]</NavLink>by setting up Discord and O’Reilly Books</li>
	<li><em>Complete the Introduction assignment by making your post and responding to at least two of your classmates</em></li>
	<li>{start(programmingAssignment)}</li>
	{/* The above items should be consistent and complete by the end of the second class session. */ }

	<li>Read Chapter 1 of “Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing” by Armando Fox
		and David Patterson (Fox) and review our Chapter 1 lecture<NavLink to='/activity/fox-chapter-01'>[video]</NavLink><sup> ~2 hours</sup></li>
	<li>Add your photo to your Blackboard profile<NavLink to='/activity/photo-to-blackboard'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li><em>Make your initial Discussion 1 post by the middle of the sprint</em></li>
	<li>Review everything that came before Chapter 1 including Preface in our Fox textbook and review associated lecture<NavLink to='/activity/fox-chapter-00'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Read Chapter 2 of Fox and review our class lecture on Chapter 2<NavLink to='/activity/fox-chapter-02'>[video]</NavLink></li>
	<li>Complete “Tools of the Trade” parts 1 and 2<NavLink to='/activity/tools'>[link]</NavLink><sup> ~3 hours</sup></li>
	<li>Complete “Hello World with Python”<NavLink to='/activity/hello-world-python'>[link]</NavLink></li>

	<li>Complete “HTML Programming - Part 1” from W3C<NavLink to='/activity/html'>[link]</NavLink><sup> ~2 hours</sup></li>

	{/* The items below should be consistent across classes. */ }
	<li>{complete(programmingAssignment)}</li>
	<li><em>Complete Discussion 1 by responding to at least two of your classmates’ posts</em></li>
	<li><em>Submit Lab 1, Quiz 1, and Reflection 1</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The best advise that I can give you for this class is to start assignments early and to always submit something. If 
you do these two things, I believe your success is virtually guaranteed.</p>
