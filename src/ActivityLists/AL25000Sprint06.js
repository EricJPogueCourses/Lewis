	<h5>Sprint 6: Multithreading and Application Programming Interfaces</h5>

	<p>Sprint 6! This sprint offers a mix of the old and the new. Some things like hosting JSON files on our Azure
	websites and enhancing our SwissArmyKnife application will be additions to what we have already learned. On the
	other hand, learning how to write multi-threaded Java applications will likely prove to be challenging.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
		<li>Develop our first multi-threaded Java application</li>
		<li>Create / update a web service by hosting JSON files on MS Azure</li>
		<li>Enhance intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
		<li>Create an automated (api level) Java test client</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You will notice this sprint that it looks like our activities list is shrinking. Don't let that fool you. At
	this point in the class many of our activities are naturally migrating from our activities list to our
	assignments. This is because you are becoming more capable of researching and figuring out how to implement new
	features. </p>

	<p>Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Review Programming Assignment 6, Quiz 6, and Discussion Board 6</em></li>
		<li>Review 'Website Creation With GitHub and Microsoft Azure' Tutorial 
			<a href='https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/github-deployment-to-azure.mp4'>[video]</a> as needed</li>
		<li>Complete 'Personal Information JSON Files' Tutorial 
			<a href='https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/personal-info-json-to-azure.mp4'>[video]</a></li>
		<li><em>Consistently work on the SwissArmyKnife v2 assignment (PA6) and Quiz 6 throughout the sprint ~10 hours</em></li>
		<li><em>Complete your initial Discussion Board post by the middle of the sprint</em></li>
		<li>Create and/or update your JSON files on your MS Azure website by the middle of the sprint to reflect the
			requirements identified in our sprint 6 assignments</li>
		<li>Review 'Performance and Multithreading'
