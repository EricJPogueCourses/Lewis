<h5>Sprint 5: Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a touch of React</h5>
<p>Sprint 5. Where does the time go?</p>
<p>Sprint 5 sees us working in the same teams but working with new technologies. We will be full speed ahead with web 
software development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hosted on Azure. We will also get our first look at React.</p>

<p>It’s also time for us to think about our final projects. How would you like to finish the class by creating 
something that makes you proud? What type of a final project would you enjoy creating? Is there a project that would 
both be interesting to create and be something you could add to your professional portfolio to show as you are looking 
for an internship or job? You have the power.</p>
