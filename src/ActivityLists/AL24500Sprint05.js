	<h5>Sprint 5: Network Programming and The Cloud</h5>

	<p>Wow! Sprint 5. How did that come so fast? I must say that I am impressed. This is a challenging class and
	it's obvious that you are working hard and delivering assignments that you are proud of delivering. Well done!</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
		<li>Develop your first network and distributed Java application</li>
		<li>Create a web service (website with JSON) utilizing the MS Azure cloud platform</li>
		<li>Develop intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
		<li>Understand Software Testing and the basics of Software Development Life Cycles</li>
		<li>Describe multiple Object-Oriented Languages and Platforms</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This sprint you will likely notice two changes. First, we will be taking a bit of a break from Java graphics
	programming and instead will focus our energy on Internet &amp; distributed programming and JSON. I think you
	will enjoy the change. But don't worry, we will get back to Java graphics programming soon enough.</p>

	<p>The second change you will see starting this sprint I will be looking for you to do more of your own research
	and decision making on assignments. For example, you will see topics this week relating to setting up Microsoft
	Azure static websites, accessing JSON files from Java, and developing more complex Java command line
	applications. In each of these cases I will be giving you some direction but will be looking for you to do the
	research and make your own choices on how you would like to implement solutions.</p>

	<p>Our activities list for this sprint include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Review Programming Assignment 5, Quiz 5, and Discussion Board 5</em></li>
		<li>Review “What is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation explained”<a href='https://www.infoworld.com/article/3222851/javascript/what-is-json-javascript-object-notation-explained.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[link]</a>
			and “JSON Introduction” from W3C <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[link]</a></li>
		<li>Complete “Azure Free Static Website”<NavLink to='/activity/azure-website'>[link]</NavLink>~3 hours</li>
		<li>Repeat the step above and create another static website that you will leave in place for the
			duration of this class. We will be utilizing this site to deploy JSON files for us to access</li>
		<li><em>Consistently work on the SwissArmyKnife assignment (PA5) ~5 hours</em></li>
		<li><em>Complete “DB5: Personal Information JSON Files“ which includes defining and creating a JSON file for
			yourself and posting it in our discussion board forum by the middle of the sprint</em></li>
		<li>Review the “OvalDraw Plus With Clicking and Dragging” application which is located in the ShapeDrawPlus
			folder in example code repository. You should compile, run, and test the functionality of the application, 
			complete a source code review, and finally create a minimal UML diagram that demonstrates inheritance and 
			ownership.</li>
		<li>Review Testing<NavLink to='/activity-oop/java-testing'>[link]</NavLink></li>
		<li><em>Complete all sprint 5 assignments and activity list items by the end of the sprint</em></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Feel free to post something in our Class Forum discussion board forum or to send me an email you have any
	questions. Also, be watching for Announcements through Blackboard during the sprint as I am sure that something
	will come up.</p><br />
