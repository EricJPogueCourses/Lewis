<h5>Sprint 5: Network Programming, Testing, and The Cloud</h5>

<p>Sprint 5. Do you feel your software development skills growing? Do you feel the power? As your skills grow you will 
realize that you are in the driver’s seat. More and more you will need to be doing your own research and decision 
making. For example, you will notice that our activities list this sprint includes Microsoft Azure and accessing JSON 
files over the Internet from Java. I will be giving you some direction but you will have the power to explore options, 
experiment, and make decisions on how you wish to implement the features. However, always remember: </p>

<br />

<p>Part of this new found responsibility will include working on your Final Project proposal. Sprint 8 will be dedicated 
to your final project. We will see if we can carve out some additional time prior to sprint 8 as well. How would you 
like to finish the class by creating something that makes you proud? What type of a final project would you enjoy 
creating? Is there a project that would both be interesting to create and be something you could add to your 
professional portfolio to show as you are looking for an internship or job? You have the power.</p>

<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'square' }}>
	<li>Develop your first network and distributed Java application</li>
