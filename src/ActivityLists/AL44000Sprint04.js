<h5>Sprint 4: Testing, Test-Driven Development, Express, Node.js, and Azure</h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 4. This sprint we are going to be focused focused on learning about Testing and Test-Driven
Development while we add the Express library to our Node.js and Azure software as a service (Saas) platform.
We will continue to utilize the “Web Development with Node and Express, 2nd Edition” by Ethan Brown from O’Reilly Books

// Todo: Consider moving from sprint 5 the activity and lab 4 question to move all applications to NodeJS and Azure.
// Todo: Add the instructions for team names if I leave it as a group assignment next semester.
// Todo: From Stephanie: There wasn't really anywhere to take off points if the health app did not work properly, except 
//     for the question where they copy/paste the url. I took off half of those points if it didn't work since it was only 
//     6 pts. Adding a separate question about the requirements/functionality might be better. 
// Todo: Review quiz questions that Ren missed on attempt 3.
