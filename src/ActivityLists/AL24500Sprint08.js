	<h5>Sprint 8: Final Project, Application Architecture, and Databases</h5>

	<p>Sprint 8! Need I say more. With one sprint left, let's finish strong. My challenge to you is to make your final
	project something that makes you proud. Not because it will get you a good grade (which it likely will), but because
	you find it useful or elegant or beautiful.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
		<ul style={{listStyleType:'square'}}>
		<li><em>Independently</em> design, develop, and enhance intermediate level graphical Java applications using 
			Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, Patterns, and Principles</li>
		<li>Understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
		<li>Understand how relational database do (and don't) support Object-Oriented Programming</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In order to do my part if giving you time to build something exceptional, I am removing all non-essential items
	this week's Activities List. As such, our list includes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Final Project, Final Project, and more Final Project</em></li>
		<li>Review Programming Assignment 8 Final Project v2, Quiz 8, and Discussion Board 8</li>
		<li>Complete “Application Architectures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Databases - Part 2”<NavLink to='/activity-architecture/application-architecture-part2'>[video]</NavLink></li>
		<li style={{color: 'red'}}>All course assignments including Programming Assignment 8 Final Project and Quiz 8 must be
			submitted at least 2 hours prior to your final project review session</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Feel free to post a note in our class forum or to send me an email you have questions.</p><br />
