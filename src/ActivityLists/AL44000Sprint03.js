<h5>Sprint 3: Application Requirements, Behavior-Driven Design, Node.js, and Azure, </h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 3. This sprint we are going to be focused on Node.js as a platform for Saas. We will be
utilizing a book from our Safari Books Online in order to help us learn more about the Node.js platform. The book
that we are utilizing learn more about Node.js and the Express framework is “Web Development with Node and Express,
2nd Edition” by Ethan Brown. You will also notice that starting in sprint 3 the assignments are becoming more open-ended and less
prescriptive. I want to encourage you to collaborate more with your peers as you work through some of the open-ended topics.</p>

	<li>Migrate all of your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap applications over to a single Node.js hosted site running locally</li>
