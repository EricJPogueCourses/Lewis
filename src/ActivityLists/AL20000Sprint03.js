<h5>Sprint 3: Algorithms, Abstraction, Variables, Expressions, and more Python</h5>

<p>Welcome to sprint 3. I hope you enjoyed our work with HTML and CSS. In this sprint we are going to get back to  
Python as we explore variables and expressions. We will also take another look at abstraction. Finally, we will look at
algorithms.</p>

<p>Let's start with what we hope to be able to do by the end of sprint 3:</p>
<ul style={{ listStyleType:'square' }}>
	<li>Identify, define, and utilize algorithms</li>
	<li>Understand and discuss computing components</li>
	<li>Effectively utilize file systems</li>
	<li>Understand variables and expressions</li>
	<li>Create and update Python 3 applications that utilize variables and expressions</li>
</ul>
