	<h5>Sprint 4: Interactive User Interfaces and Mosaic</h5>

	<p>Welcome to sprint 4. We have covered a lot of material in the first three sprints. I suspect
	that the FaceDraw programming assignment was challenging. As we near the halfway point of our course, we will
	continue to focus on delivering real software each sprint. This week we will continue with enhancing our
	programming skills by learning how to develop <em>interactive</em> applications while also learning how to
	read and write files.</p>

	<p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
	<ul style={{ listStyleType: "square" }}>
		<li>Develop <em>interactive</em> graphical Java applications utilizing Listeners</li>
		<li>Describe how to develop <em>interactive</em> command-line Java applications utilizing Scanner</li>
		<li>Develop Java applications that read and write files including JSON files</li>
		<li>Understand JavaDoc and how it can create self-documenting source code</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please let me know if you need assistance. If you struggled with FaceDraw, it might help if we had a chance
	to sit down and talk through how we can get things back on track for the remainder of the course. I am here to
	help.</p>
